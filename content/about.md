# About Us

### Ebenezer Nkawate, *president*, San Francisco

![Ebenezer](/images/ebenezer.jpg)

Hello, I’m Ebenezer Nkwate and it’s my honor to serve as Class alumni president. Traveling from Cameroon to MIT made me fully embrace the diversity of people I met at MIT as I built new friends and bonds. These bonds especially with many other members of our 2017 class have not only inspired me to grow but to give back.

If you find yourself in the Bay Area, please get in touch as I am always willing to meet more members of our class and assist if need be.

I am presently working as a software developer for Oracle, Pleasanton, CA. However, continuing my interest in the intersection of medicine and engineering, I am working on a medical dispenser to prevent liquid medication overdose. 
I will love to talk more about various stuff so get in touch.

“Our success is not a gift, but a debt we owe the future”

Hi! I'm Rebecca Gallivan, and I am a course 3 currently pursuing my PhD in Material Science at Caltech.  Previously I worked on biologically inspired materials for wet-environments and I hope to continue developing new materials that solve industrial problems and are environmentally positive.  I am originally from the Seattle area, love the great outdoors, and I am always down to travel.  I am very excited to help keep the Class of 2017 community strong!  Questions about event funding can be directed to me.

### Andrew Xia, *Webmaster*

Hi! I'm Andrew, and I graduated from MIT in 6-2 and 18. I am spending the 2017-8 Academic year pursuing my MEng in cryptography, and I hope to continue a PhD afterwards. I grew up in Hong Kong, Tokyo, and spent my high school years around Boston. I am passionate about photography, traveling, and planespotting, and I would always love to hang out. At MIT I was involved with Pi Lambda Phi, East Campus, MIT Technique, and Amphibious Achievement. I'm the webmaster for the class council -help in the form of pull requests are always welcome!

My name is Nikhil, I graduated with a degree in computer science. During my four years, I was fortunate to be a part of the Bombers, Zeta Psi, Mirchi and the squash team.. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Engineering here at MIT and am working at Acquia. I am super passionate about adrenaline sports, TED talks, public speaking and event management. My bucket list still includes going to Tomorrowland, skydiving at the Grand Canyon, shark cage diving and visiting Ayia Napa, Mykonos and Sharm El Sheikh. My biggest dream is run Caesar's Palace!
