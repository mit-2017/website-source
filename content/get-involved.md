# Get Involved

### Member at Large 

If you would like to join the class council, please fill out [this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdvwK_1YI1wudoePuuoxnJjIJiY7uNM6L4rjrQYk6JZQKJhZA/viewform?usp=sf_link) form!

The member at large's responsibilities are listed [here](https://alum.mit.edu/volunteering/VolunteerTools/ClassVolunteerToolkit/ClassOrganizations/Class_Officer_Job_Descriptions#a7). Essentially, you can help us be a point person for the location that you are in.

### Host an Event!

You may also request funding for events that you'd like to run, as long as the events are available to all members of the Class of 2017! Fill out a funding request here [TODO]
