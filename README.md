# Welcome to the MIT 2017 Alumni Website

## How to use

This webpage uses [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as a static blog generator. This, you need to install hugo. I installed from the source code -that requires also having [Go](https://golang.org/) installed. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)

Once you have done so, let's clone the repo

````bash
git clone https://github.com/mit-2017/website-source.git
cd website-source
````
